How to make each plot


Corrected time-charge relation
dtint30_c22.pdf
makeResolution.cc Macro
IntDt(2, 2, "t1065_run_30.root", true, "dtint30_c22")

Uncorrected time-charge relation
dtint30_c22.pdf
makeResolution.cc Macro
IntDt(2, 2, "t1065_run_30.root", false, "dtint30_c22")

Example Highest energy pixel algorithm time resolution
exdtHI.pdf
makeResolution.cc Macro
TimeResolution("t1065_run_30.root", false, "exdtHI")

Example weighted energy algorithm time resolution
exdtWI.pdf
makeResolution.cc Macro
TimeResolution("t1065_run_30.root", false, "exdtWI")

Example Mean charge deposit
exint.pdf
makeResolution.cc Macro
ExInt("exint")

Y-axis projection
projection.pdf
makeResolution.cc Macro
MakeProjection("projection")
! Here you must change the hardcoded root file directories accordingly. Need analyzed runs 30, 32, 34

Example photonis signal pulse
pulsepix.pdf
makeResolution.cc Macro
MakePulses(1, 2, 2, "t1065_run_30.root", "pulsepix")

Example photek signal pulse
pulseref.pdf
makeResolution.cc Macro
MakePulses(1, 0, 2, "t1065_run_30.root", "pulseref")

Shower maximum distribution
run3*dist.pdf
makeResolution.cc Macro
MaximumDist("t1065_run_3*.root", "run3*dist")

Spatial resolution
sres.pdf / sres_cutoff.pdf
centers.py script
python centers.py
! Comment out runs as you found fit in clistI.
! for 0.3 mm you have to comment out 28,29, 35-42
! Pick to your liking

Time resolution per run
timeres.pdf
A little more involved
in t3-higgs:
./makePlot /wntmp/fpresutti/misc/timeres.pdf /wntmp/fpresutti/graphs/t1065_run_*.root
then scp over to local machine from /wntmp/fpresutti/misc/, or just download all data and do locally

Calibrated time resolution
timerescalib.pdf
./makePlot2 /wntmp/fpresutti/misc/timerescalib.pdf /wntmp/fpresutti/calibrations/self/*.root /wntmp/fpresutti/calibrations/ref/*.root
and copy to local machine from /wntmp/fpresutti/misc/
